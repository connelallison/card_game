# The History of Everything

***The History of Everything*** is an online card game in the style of *Hearthstone*. It is written in TypeScript, and uses React in the front end.

The main focus of my work has been on the gameplay code (located in the server/src/game directory), which is broadly representative of its final state. By contrast, the client and the server.ts file are prototypes created to facilitate development of the rest of the game; if the project is someday fully realised, the front end will be replaced entirely with a client created using a conventional game engine, and the server code will be rewritten from scratch to be clean, performant, and scalable.

If you have experience with *Hearthstone*, you may like to try the demo, which is hosted on AWS. It can be played here:
