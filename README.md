To set up and view the game:

1. Open 2 terminal tabs.
2. In one tab, navigate to the server directory.
3. Run "npm install" inside the server directory to install the server's packages.
4. Run "npm start" inside the server directory.
5. In the other tab, navigate to the client directory.
6. Run "npm install" inside the client directory to install the client's packages.
7. Run "npm start" inside the client directory.
8. This should automatically open the game for you, but if it does not, use a web browser and go to "http://localhost:3000/".
9. If you like, you may open multiple tabs at this address - each will be treated by the server as a separate client, and you can see a different game in each tab.
10. If you would like to connect to the game from another device in your network, check the terminal tab where the client is running - it should provide the required address.
