    tips: `- Battle of Suiyang is a very powerful card - try to have it in your opening hand if you can.
        - Your Prisoners and Slaves are fodder for Battle of Suiyang - aim to play it while you have a board full of disposable followers.
        - Kunstoffiziers are a very good early game play, and can potentially snowball out of your opponent's control within a few turns.
        - Try to get Wu Zetian killed before you play Henry VIII, to take advantage of her Legacy effect.
        - Don't be afraid to use Stalin's leader technique. A particularly good strategy is to play all but one charge of a nameless follower, and then discard the last one to get a fresh card.`,
