    description: `Re-enact the Third Servile War in this aggressive Underclass deck. Lead a bandit of misfits, each with their own quirks and difficulties, and unlock their full power under the leadership of Spartacus. `,
    tips: `- Be careful with your Helots. Don't play them on an empty board!
           - Be careful with your Subprime Borrowers. Kill them off quickly, before they become a liability.
           - Be careful with your Nika Hooligans. They don't work well in groups.
           - Your Slaves and Selma Marchers aren't a very good aggressive play.
           - None of the above applies when your followers are Spartacus.
           - The Statue of Liberty and Tupac Hologram are an effective combination.`,
